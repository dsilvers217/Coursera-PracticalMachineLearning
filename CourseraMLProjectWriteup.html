<p class=MsoNormal>Coursera Practical Machine Learning Final Project</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goal of the project is to write a machine learning
algorithm to predict the activity quality form the activity monitors. A look
through the dataset shows there are five possible outcomes, labeled A-E. Because
the goal is to assign a label to each case, a classification algorithm would be
best since it assigns a factor as the outcome. A randomForest algorithm will be
used since it will already assign a factor as the outcome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data is available from two csv files, which consist of
what I term the training data and the testing data. The training data contains
over 19000 entry rows which will be used to train the fitting method and for
validation purposes. The testing data contains the 20 entries which we want to
accurately predict for the assignment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dataset contains 159 possible predictors. This is a
large number, and we want to prune predictors which have little or no
correlation with the final result. Several columns in the dataset have a high number
of entries which are empty (NA), which means they would have little effect on
the fit since so many entries would be skipped. If a column in the training
data has more than 80% NA entries, it is removed from the dataset. This removes
nearly 70 columns from the dataset. Next, while the training dataset may have
columns which have a large number of nonzero entries, the testing dataset still
<span class=GramE>contains</span> columns which are completely empty (NA).
Since these columns are empty in the testing dataset, they will not contribute
to the final prediction, so it doesn’t make sense to include them in the
training dataset. If a column is more than 80% empty in the testing dataset,
the column is removed from the training and testing datasets. About 20 more
columns are removed from the dataset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goal of the project is to predict the outcome of the
exercise based on the accelerometer data. The first seven columns contain no
accelerometer data, so are not useful for the fit. These first seven columns
are removed from the datasets. All remaining columns in the dataset are now
predominantly nonempty and are all from the accelerometer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The training dataset is then divided into a training and
validation datasets, which contain 80% and 20% of the original dataset,
respectively. The new training data subset is used to train the data using the
randomForest method using all remaining columns in the dataset. A fit is then
done to the training dataset to get the in sample error, the validation set for
the out of sample error, and on the training dataset to get the answers for the
assignment. The in sample error is calculated to be 0% and the out of sample
error to be .28%. <span class=GramE>This our</span> of sample error is small
enough that I have a high probability of accurately predicting all 20 cases in
the testing dataset. (An out of sample error of 5% would indicate that I have a
high probability of only getting 19 of the 20 testing cases correct. Since the
out of sample error is less than 1/10 of 5%, there is a high degree of
confidence to get all 20 cases correct).</p>
